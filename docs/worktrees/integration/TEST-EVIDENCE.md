# Integration test evidence

## Baseline checkpoint

- Worktree registration: PASS at the exact requested path.
- Branch: `photon-v3/integration`.
- Starting HEAD/F0: `ee2f8576b55973eee312bca5cad0549b6f959a88`.
- Initial status: clean; no staged, unstaged, untracked, or relocation-only files.
- Origin: `https://github.com/tecxbro/grokbotonimessage.git`.
- Remote main: `5c342f5eeb654b1ad7cb00e52855b425f25148ae`, matching local `origin/main` at inspection.
- Remote integration branch/F0 tag: not advertised at inspection.
- Lane commit ancestry/path review: PASS; all selected commits descend directly from F0 and lane deltas do not overlap one another.

## Working-path checkpoint

Runtime: bundled Node 24.19.0 and npm 10.9.2. Dependencies were installed with
`npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`; tracked files were unchanged.

- `npm run photon:build`: PASS.
- `node --test packages/photon-features/dist/tests/e2e/feature-runtime.test.js`:
  PASS, 1/1, no skips. The offline Spectrum send is invoked once and only once.
- Focused compiled WT-01/02/03 lane suites: PASS, 80/80, no skips.
- Focused compiled WT-01/02/03/08 lane suites: 90/91 PASS, no skips. The sole
  failure is WT-08 `PINNED_NODE_REQUIRED`: the synthetic installed artifact pins
  exact Node 24.13.0 while the candidate runs package-supported Node 24.19.0.

The passing round trip is candidate-local/offline evidence: CLI input,
authenticated socket, durable persistence/claim, public F0 execution, public text
handler, and offline Spectrum SDK acceptance. It does not prove installation,
activation, remote provider acceptance, delivery, read, rendering, or device behavior.
