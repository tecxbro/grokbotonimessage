# Integration test evidence

## Baseline checkpoint

- Worktree registration: PASS at the exact requested path.
- Branch: `photon-v3/integration`.
- Starting HEAD/F0: `ee2f8576b55973eee312bca5cad0549b6f959a88`.
- Initial status: clean; no staged, unstaged, untracked, or relocation-only files.
- Origin: `https://github.com/tecxbro/grokbotonimessage.git`.
- Remote main: `5c342f5eeb654b1ad7cb00e52855b425f25148ae`, matching local `origin/main` at inspection.
- Remote integration branch/F0 tag: not advertised at inspection.
- Lane commit ancestry/path review: PASS; all selected commits descend directly from F0 and lane deltas do not overlap one another.

No implementation or aggregate test result is recorded yet. Lane results in
`included-commits.json` remain lane-local/offline evidence and are not candidate
evidence. The next evidence checkpoint is the working-path local round trip after
exact WT-01/02/03/08 integration and host wiring.
